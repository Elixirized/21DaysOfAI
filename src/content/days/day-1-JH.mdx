# Install VSCode

If you don't already have VSCode installed, go do that [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## VSCode Command Palette

The Command Palette in VS Code is a powerful feature that allows you to quickly access
commands and features by typing their names. It's like a shortcut hub for all the actions
within the editor.

To open it, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac), and start typing your command. It's
awesome because it speeds up your workflow by letting you jump to any function without
navigating through menus or remembering keyboard shortcuts.
