# Install VSCode

If you don't already have VSCode installed, go do that [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## VSCode Command Palette

The Command Palette in VS Code is a powerful feature that allows you to quickly access
commands and features by typing their names. It's like a shortcut hub for all the actions
within the editor.

{/*

Below the keys is the label Command Palette in gray text. The design is clean and modern with a neutral tone.](../../../public/images/command-palette-photo.png) is not a valid image path. The image is not found in the specified location.

To open it, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac), and start typing your command. It's
awesome because it speeds up your workflow by letting you jump to any function without
navigating through menus or remembering keyboard shortcuts.

# Install VSCode Extensions

To make the most of your Python development experience in VSCode, you'll want to install some essential extensions. Here are a few key extensions that will enhance your workflow:

1. **Python**: This extension provides rich support for Python, including IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and code navigation. It is essential for any Python development in VSCode.

2. **Jupyter**: This extension allows you to work with Jupyter notebooks directly within VSCode. It provides a great interface for running and editing notebooks, making it easier to work with data science projects and AI models.

3. **Pylance**: This is a fast and feature-rich language server for Python, providing improved IntelliSense and type checking. It works seamlessly with the Python extension to enhance your coding experience.

4. **GitLens**: This extension supercharges the built-in Git capabilities of VSCode. It provides insights into code authorship, history, and more, making it easier to collaborate on projects

5. **Prettier - Code formatter**: This extension helps maintain consistent code formatting across your projects. It supports multiple languages, including Python, and can be configured to run automatically on save.

6. **Live Share**: This extension allows you to collaborate in real-time with others directly within VSCode. It's great for pair programming or code reviews.

7. **Docker**: If you're working with containerized applications, this extension provides support for Docker, allowing you to build, manage, and deploy containers directly from VSCode.

8. **Remote - SSH**: This extension allows you to connect to remote machines via SSH and work with files and folders as if they were local. It's useful for working on remote servers or cloud instances.

9. **Path Intellisense**: This extension provides autocompletion for file paths in your code, making it easier to navigate and reference files within your project.

10. **Python Extention Pack**: This is a collection of essential Python extensions that includes the Python, Pylance, and Jupyter extensions, among others. It simplifies the setup process by bundling these key tools together.

11. **GitHub Copilot**: This AI-powered code completion tool helps you write code faster and with fewer errors by suggesting entire lines or blocks of code based on your input. It can be a game-changer for productivity, especially in complex projects.

12. **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues**: This extension allows you to manage GitHub pull requests and issues directly within VSCode. It streamlines the code review process and makes it easier to collaborate on projects hosted on GitHub.

13. **Ruff**: This is a fast Python linter that helps you catch errors and enforce coding standards in your Python code. It integrates well with the Python extension and provides real-time feedback as you code.

14. **Better Comments**: This extension helps you create more readable and organized comments in your code by allowing you to categorize comments with different colors and styles. It can improve code readability and make it easier to understand the purpose of different sections of your code.

There are many more extensions available in the VSCode marketplace, but these are some of the most essential ones for Python development and AI projects. You can install them by searching for their names in the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on Mac) and clicking the Install button.

import plotly.express as px
print("All libraries imported successfully!")

# Cell 2: Test data handling
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': range(10),
    'y': np.random.randn(10)
})
print(df.head())

# Cell 3: Test visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.plot(df['x'], df['y'])
plt.title('Test Plot')
plt.show()
```

### Test Web Framework

```python
# In Jupyter cell or separate file
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return '<h1>Hello, Business Web App!</h1>'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

---

## First Web App

### Simple Streamlit Dashboard
Create file `dashboard.py`:
```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

st.title('Business Dashboard')

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Month': ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May'],
    'Revenue': [10000, 12000, 15000, 11000, 18000],
    'Expenses': [8000, 9000, 10000, 8500, 12000]
})

# Display metrics
col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
with col1:
    st.metric('Total Revenue', f"${data['Revenue'].sum():,}")
with col2:
    st.metric('Total Expenses', f"${data['Expenses'].sum():,}")
with col3:
    profit = data['Revenue'].sum() - data['Expenses'].sum()
    st.metric('Net Profit', f"${profit:,}")

# Display chart
fig = px.line(data, x='Month', y=['Revenue', 'Expenses'], 
              title='Revenue vs Expenses')
st.plotly_chart(fig)

# Display data table
st.subheader('Raw Data')
st.dataframe(data)
```

Run with:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

### Project Structure
```
business-web-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ venv/                 # Virtual environment
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/            # Jupyter notebooks
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Source code
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                 # Data files
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/            # HTML templates
â”œâ”€â”€ static/               # CSS, JS, images

â”œâ”€â”€ .env                  # Environment variables
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation
```

### Best Practices
1. **Always use virtual environments**
2. **Keep requirements.txt updated**
3. **Use .env files for sensitive data**
4. **Version control with Git**
5. **Document your code**
6. **Test your applications**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Permission Errors
```bash
# Use --user flag if needed
pip install --user package_name
```

### Command Not Found
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
# Check PATH includes Python scripts directory
echo $PATH | grep python
```

### Module Import Errors
```bash
# Verify package installation
pip list | grep package_name
# Reinstall if necessary
pip install --force-reinstall package_name
```

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill process using port (Linux/macOS)
lsof -ti:8888 | xargs kill -9

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :8888
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

## Day 1 Recap
Today, we set up our development environment for building business web applications using Python. We installed VSCode, configured essential extensions, and set up a virtual environment. We also explored the Jupyter notebook interface and created a simple web application using Flask and Streamlit.
Installing essential libraries for data handling, visualization, and web development. We also created a simple Streamlit dashboard to visualize business metrics.
We learned how to create a project structure that is easy to navigate and maintain and also discussed best practices for managing dependencies, using virtual environments, and documenting our code.
We also covered troubleshooting common issues that may arise during setup and development. This included permission errors, command not found errors, module import errors, and port conflicts.
The importance of using version control with Git and keeping our requirements.txt file updated was discussed, and we learned how to use .env files to manage sensitive data and environment variables.
Discussing the importance of documenting our code and using comments to explain complex logic, we learned how to use MDX to create documentation files and how to use Jupyter notebooks to create interactive documentation.
This setup provides a solid foundation for developing business web applications with Python and Jupyter Notebooks, we will discuss essential libraries across all major platforms in more depth in the coming days. Also, the face of AI development changes day to day and we will be updating this as we go along.
