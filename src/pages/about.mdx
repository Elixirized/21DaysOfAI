## 100 Days is Too Long

_100 Days of Code_ became famous for getting people up to speed with Python in just 100 days,
and we applaud that.

With the emergence of AI tools to help people create software code, writing software can
be accelerated by 2X, 3X, maybe even 5X. Even after working around the AI hallucinations (which
are rapidly decreasing), using those tools to help us write code is truly a game-changer.

It follows, then, that getting up to speed on creating AI _applications_ (meaning: software that
uses AI tools) shouldn't take us the same 100 days that it used to take just to learn a single
programming language and toolset.

> Should that be twice as fast? 3 times as fast?

To avoid spending cycles debating that, we settled on **2.3809523800952381** as fast, or
100/2.3809523800952381 = **42 days**.
