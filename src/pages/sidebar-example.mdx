# Here is the Title

Here is a bunch of text outside of the part that is affected by the sidebar(??)

  <div style="display: flex; gap:1rem; margin:2rem 0;">
    {/* <main style="flex:1; padding:1rem;">
    ## Section Next To Sidebar

    This chunk of Markdown will live beside the sidebar. You can write
    lists, prose, code blocks, whatever.
    </main> */}

    <Sidebar>
      <SidebarContent />
    </Sidebar>
  </div>
  

# Another Full-Width Section

And now weâ€™re back to full-width Markdown without any sidebar wrapping.
